                                  There are times when employers have concerns or issues regarding an employeeâ€™s work. 
                                  It is important for employers to follow due process when managing a disciplinary procedure.

                                  In order to do this there should be a written disciplinary procedure in place which is accessible to all employees. 
                                  This should clearly outline what type of behaviour and performance could lead to disciplinary action, the action the employer is likely to take
                                   and it should confirm that there will be an opportunity for the employee to provide an explanation.

                                  Once the disciplinary procedure has been clearly defined, the employer is able to follow a 
                                  pre-defined structure which will ensure that the disciplinary procedure will be handled correctly and fairly for both parties.
